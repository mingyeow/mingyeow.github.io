Hi, I am Ming. 

My current interests lies in systems, ecosystems and infrastructure. 

In recent years, I have been working on initiatives with different projects, including <a href="http://kyber.network">Kyber</a>, <a href="http://instadapp.io">Instadapp</a>, <a href="http://blockfolio.com">Blockfolio</a>, <a href="http://handshake.org">Handshake</a>, <a href="http://wtc.network">WBTC</a> and others.

I am also rethinking some of our most entrenched ideas: science, authority, money, journalism, and capitalism. 

I pioneered a number of key ideas around growth, engagement and analytics, with some of the key concepts captured <a href="http://is.gd/op2">here</a>.
